I have developed a java swing application in netbeans ide.
This game is developed using
Java Swing - for building GUI
Backtracking - to find solution to the sudoku puzzle
Data structures - it uses array list data structure to store numbers 

here is the more information about implementation of the classes and constructors

There is a simple jar that will run on any system that has jre in it.
Thank you
